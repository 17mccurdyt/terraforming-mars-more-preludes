Terraforming Mars Boardgame

Hopefully will eventually use this repository for playing terraforming mars online. The board game is great, this repository highly recommends purchasing [it](https://www.amazon.com/Stronghold-Games-6005SG-Terraforming-Board/dp/B01GSYA4K2) for personal use. If you want to play with people online, you can use this tool.

## Demo

You can try online [here](https://terraforming-mars.herokuapp.com/). Please post any issues found.

## Running

You can run the game server locally if you have `npm` and `node`. To start the game server run the `start` script.

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This will start the game server listening on the default port of 8080. If you then point a web browser to http://localhost:8080 you will be on the create game screen.
