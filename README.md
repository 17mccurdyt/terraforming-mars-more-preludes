Terraforming Mars Boardgame

Hopefully will eventually use this repository for playing terraforming mars online. The board game is great, this repository highly recommends purchasing [it](https://www.amazon.com/Stronghold-Games-6005SG-Terraforming-Board/dp/B01GSYA4K2) for personal use. If you want to play with people online, you can use this tool.

## First Release?

I have finished adding the logic for all of the cards and the games. The GUI needs a lot of love but the game might be playable. I am adding unit tests to attempt to test all the cards in isolation as the logic to play them through the GUI takes time. For now I am playing through single player games and fixing issues as I find them. I would think sometime during Q2 or 2019 it will be possible to play through a game with a less than ideal GUI. Once the game logic is working I will then focus on improving the GUI.
